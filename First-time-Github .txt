This is my first repo
I am currently understanding how this repo works
more attention in doing this.
see now I am editing this file.
this is my first edit in github.
this is my second edit
getting the flavour of using it
git-version control software which keeps track of all changes that are done in your project
github- it is a userface which handles the git.
Repo-It is like creating a new project
Commit-saving the work done.
