This is my first repo
I am currently understanding how this repo works
more attention in doing this.
see now I am editing this file.
this is my first edit in github.
this is my second edit
getting the flavour of using it
git-version control software which keeps track of all changes that are done in your project
github- it is a userface which handles the git.
Repo-It is like creating a new project
Commit-saving the work done.
what is this creating a branch mean?
you have an idea and think that you don't know it really works or it is a good idea or not
for that u can have mutliple branches and check which really suits this.
what i did until this point
      . <- commit       }
      |                 |
      . <- commit       | --- this is main
      |                 | 
      . <- commit       }
     / 
    . <- branch (this is something you tried to worked it on)
